Scenario 
You have four advertisement options (bandits), and your task is to design an experiment using 
Epsilon Greedy and Thompson Sampling. 

Design of Experiment 
A bandit class has already been created for you. It is an abstract class with abstract methods. You 
must not exclude anything from the Bandit() class. However, you can add more stuff if you 
need.
